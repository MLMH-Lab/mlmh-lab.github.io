Currently, my main focus is to develop machine learning models to diagnose patients based on structural MRI. In general, my main interest is to benefit from the huge amount of data being acquired in neuroscience, using machine learning, to make a positive impact on the field.

I am a PhD in astrophysics. In astrophysics, I have mainly worked with machine learning applications to extract patterns from imaging and spectroscopy. Now I am transferring my knowledge from astrophysics to neuroscience, trying to leverage the science of our team with a multidisciplinary approach.
