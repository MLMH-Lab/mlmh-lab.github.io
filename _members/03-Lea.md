As part of my MSc Neuroscience (Neuroimaging) degree at Kingâ€™s College London, I explored the use of Support Vector Machine models for the differential classification of psychosis, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in MRI data. These psychiatric disorders tend to present with overlapping symptoms, so they are difficult to distinguish in clinical practice. In line with this, my main research interest lies in the application of machine learning to neuroimaging data to support clinicians in detecting and treating psychiatric disorders as early as possible.
