Hello there! I am a computer scientist and an engineer with a PhD in Neuroscience and Cognition from Universidade Federal do ABC (Brazil). I have a long-time interest in machine learning methods (especially Deep Learning) and neuroimaging. Besides my job in the lab, I have a position as a Assistant Professor in the Universidade Federal do ABC.
