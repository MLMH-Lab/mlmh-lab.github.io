**Description**


Machine Learning is an area of artificial intelligence involving the development of algorithms to discover trends and patterns in existing data; this information can then be used to make predictions on new data. A growing number of researchers and clinicians are using machine learning methods to develop and validate tools for assisting the diagnosis and treatment of patients with brain disorders. Machine Learning: Methods and Applications to Brain Disorders provides an up-to-date overview of how these methods can be applied to brain disorders, including both psychiatric and neurological disease. This book is written for a non-technical audience, such as neuroscientists, psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists and health care practitioners.

**Key Features**

- Provides a non-technical introduction to machine learning and applications to brain disorders

- Includes a detailed description of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms as well as some novel and promising approaches

- Covers the main methodological challenges in the application of machine learning to brain disorders

- Provides a step-by-step tutorial for implementing a machine learning pipeline to neuroimaging data in Python

**Readership**

Advanced students and researchers in behavioral neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and neurology
